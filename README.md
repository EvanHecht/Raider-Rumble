# Raider-Rumble
My Senior Design project for my Software Engineering degree from MSOE. It's a platform fighter game where the characters are based on majors offered at MSOE and the stages are based on locations around the MSOE campus. We also built a custom arcade cabinet to house the game for the senior design show, and donated it to the university upon completion.
